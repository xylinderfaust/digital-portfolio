```{tab-item} Things I Learned
* The overall structure of a Jupyter Book was new to me, and I enjoyed learning about how they are put together.
* I found it particularly informative to learn how the MyST syntax is used to produce different formatting outputs.
```

```{tab-item} Thing I Found Difficult
* I wouldn't say anything was particularly 'difficult' per se, however I do need a lot more practice with Markdown. I found that I was needing to refer back to reference material frequently.
* The utilization of cell and notebook metadata configuration in the .ipynb files was very interesting, and I would have enjoyed delving into this in a bit more depth as these offer very powerful configuration and formatting capabilities.
